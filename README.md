# Advent of Code 2024 with Claude in Java

Testing Claude AI for Advent of code. These solutions are written by Claude in Java. I'm not a Java developer.

## How I prompted
I used Claude project and uploaded following files for context: puzzle holding copy pasted puzzle text without solutions.
Puzzle input in txt file and 1 previous solution as example.

I prompted in style of "solve this puzzle in java. Day2part1 is an example of part 1 solution. day2.txt holds the data"
Project has empty instructions.


## Day 1
Claude solved technically in 1 prompt for each phase. Few extra prompts were needed to get the solution in this format.

## Day 2
Claude once again had no issues solving this. Only took 1 prompts for each.
I had to modify file paths for input file and that was about it.
